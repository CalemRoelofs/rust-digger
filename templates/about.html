    We are collecting data about <a href="https://crates.io/">Rust Crates</a>. Similar to the <a href="https://pydigger.com/">PyDigger</a> project collecting data about Python packages,
    the <a href="https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/">CPAN Digger</a> project collecting about Perl packages, and the <a href="https://ruby-digger.code-maven.com/">Ruby Digger</a> about Ruby Gems.

      <li class="list-item">Having a link to the public VCS of each crate will make it easier contribute to the project.
         So we would like to encourage everyone to have a link to the public VCS of the crate in the <b>repository</b> field.
         Make sure they follow a standard. (e.g. use https in the link, link to a page that is not redirecting, etc.).
         We try to identify the various VCS hosting services.

    <h2 class="title is-4">Status</h2>
    There are already some pages that work, but there are a lot of <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/rust-digger/issues">open issues</a> and there are probably a lot more tasks that don't have an issue yet.

    This is the first project written by the author in Rust and thus the code is very far from being "good Rust code". Your suggestions and contributions are welcome.

    Right now in each listing we show the 100 most recently uploaded crates from the given list.
    We believe that contributing to a recently uploaded crate will more likely get a response than a crate that has not been touched for a long time.
    With that said we plan to create pagination to make it easier to go over all the crates.

    <h2 class="title is-4">Repository</h2>
    Each crate has a file called <b>Cargo.toml</b> in which there must be a section called <b>[package]</b> in which there can be a key called <b>repository</b>. e.g
    <code>
    [package]
    repository = "https://github.com/szabgab/rustatic"
    </code>

    Rust Digger is an open source project developed and maintained by <a href="https://szabgab.com/">Gabor Szabo</a>. Its <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/rust-digger/">source code</a> is in GitHub. You are welcome to <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/rust-digger/issues">open issues</a>, to implement features, recommend improvements to the code or help with the text or the design of the web site.

<section class="section" id="no-commit-count">
  <div class="container">
    <h2 class="title is-4">NA for commit count</h2>
    If you see <b>NA</b> in the commit count column it can mean that either the crate does not have a <b>repository</b> entry, we could not access it, or the Rust Digger just have not got around to process it yet.

    <p>
      Each Crate can have a field in the <b>Cargo.toml</b> called <b>repository</b> with the URL of their public Version Control System (VCS). Usually on some git-hosting services.
      For example the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rustatic">rustatic</a> crate has <b>repository = "https://github.com/szabgab/rustatic/"</b> in its <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/rustatic/blob/main/Cargo.toml">Cargo.toml</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Having that link in the Cargo.toml file means that users can easily find the source code of the crate. It is listed on <a href="https://crates.io/">Crates.io</a>, <a href="https://lib.rs/">lib.rs</a>, the <a href="/">Rust Digger</a>, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are the author of the crate then it is easy to add the entry. You do have a public repository for the project, don't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are not the author, then it is a bit tricky as first you need to find the repository.
      <ul>
        <li>Each crate on the Rust Digger should have a link to its owner. (If not, that's a <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/rust-digger/issues/41">problem</a>)</li>
        <li>Each owner has a link to his/her GitHub user. After all the username on crates.io is the same as the username on GitHub.</li>
        <li>Following that link you can list all the repositories of the person and you <b>might</b> find the one corresponding to this crate.</li>
        <li>If you found the repository then edit the Cargo.toml file and add the <b>repository</b> entry to it. Then send it as a Pull-Request.</li>
        <li>Alternatively, you might take a look at the other crates of the owner to see where is their repository. According to our <a href="/stats">stats</a>, about 5% of the crates are hosted in some system that is not GitHub.</li>
        <li>If you can't find the repository then you could, politely(!) contact the owner and ask if the crates is indeed theirs and if they have a public VCS somewhere.
          Keep in mind that some people don't make their VCS public and some don't even use one. I am not happy about it, but I would not want to make them uncomfortable.
