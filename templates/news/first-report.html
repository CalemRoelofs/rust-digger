     I started to write the <b>Rust Digger</b> on Sat Jun 17 11:08:42 2023 +0300, slightly more than a month ago. At first, as I was just started to learn Rust,
     it went extremely slowly, but after a few weeks it started to have some form. I even located a few crates that either linked to <b>http://github.com</b> (instead of <b>https</b>)
     or that they were linking to <b>www.github.com</b> instead of <b>github.com</b>. Neither are big issues, but I sent a few Pull-requests to fix these
     and I think most of those PRs were accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
    This is the first report based on the data collected by the <a href="/">Rust Digger</a>. Below you can find a copy of the <a href="/stats">stats</a> page.
    A few highlights: We found 120,484 crates. Almost 80% of them have a link to their <b>repository</b> (Public version control system). An additional 3% have
    a value in the <b>homepage</b> field. In many cases that is actully the link to their repository. <b>17.17%</b> of them have neither <b>repository</b> nor
    <b>homepage</b>.
    </p>
    Almost 75% of all the crates use GitHub as their repository leaving 5% for the rest of the services. GitLab has 2.68%. There are also 1,821 crates (1.51% of all the crates)
    where we did not categorize the repository yet. That still needs some manual work. Some of these  have <b>http</b> link to github.com.
