        {% when "no-repo" %}
          The list of all the crates that have no "reposiotry" entry in their Cargo.toml file. Some of them might have a link to their repositry
          in some other field (e.g. the <a href="/has-homepage-but-no-repo">homepage field</a>) other have no such link
          <a href="/no-homepage-no-repo">neither in the homepage nor the repository field</a>.
          You can find <a href="/about-repository">futher explanation</a> and a way to fix this.
        {% when "has-homepage-but-no-repo" %}
          Some crates have a <b>homepage</b> field in their <b>Cargo.toml</b> file, but no <b>repository</b> field.
          It would be probably better if all the crates had their repository listed in the <b>repository</b> field, but
          it is probably even more importan that the crates the have
          <a href="/no-homepage-no-repo">neither homepage nor repository field</a> would get the <b>repository</b> field.
          You can find <a href="/about-repository">futher explanation</a>.
        {% when "no-homepage-no-repo" %}
          List of crates that don't have a "repositry" field in their Cargo.toml file and not even a "homepage" field that might help locating the repository.
          In order to make it easier for user of a crate to find the public VCS (Version Control System) of the crate, it is recommended that each crate
          will include the <b>repository</b> filed in the Cargo.toml file.

          You can find <a href="/about-repository">futher explanation</a> and how you might help fixing this.
