    <p>
      Each Crate can have a field in the <b>Cargo.toml</b> called <b>repository</b> with the URL of their public Version Control System (VCS). Usually on some git-hosting services.
      For example the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rustatic">rustatic</a> crate has <b>repository = "https://github.com/szabgab/rustatic/"</b> in its <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/rustatic/blob/main/Cargo.toml">Cargo.toml</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Having that link in the Cargo.toml file means that users can easily find the source code of the crate. It is listed on <a href="https://crates.io/">Crates.io</a>, <a href="https://lib.rs/">lib.rs</a>, the <a href="/">Rust Digger</a>, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are the author of the crate then it is easy to add the entry. You do have a public repository for the project, don't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are not the author, then it is a bit tricky as first you need to find the repository.
      <ul>
        <li>Each crate on the Rust Digger should have a link to its owner. (If not, that's a <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/rust-digger/issues/41">problem</a>)</li>
        <li>Each owner has a link to his/her GitHub user. After all the username on crates.io is the same as the username on GitHub.</li>
        <li>Following that link you can list all the repositories of the person and you <b>might</b> find the one corresponding to this crate.</li>
        <li>If you found the repository then edit the Cargo.toml file and add the <b>repository</b> entry to it. Then send it as a Pull-Request.</li>
        <li>Alternatively, you might take a look at the other crates of the owner to see where is their repository. According to our <a href="/stats">stats</a>, about 5% of the crates are hosted in some system that is not GitHub.</li>
        <li>If you can't find the repository then you could, politely(!) contact the owner and ask if the crates is indeed theirs and if they have a public VCS somewhere.
          Keep in mind that some people don't make their VCS public and some don't even use one. I am not happy about it, but I would not want to make them uncomfortable.  
        </li>
      </ul>
